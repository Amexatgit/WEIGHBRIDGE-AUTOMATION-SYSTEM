## üöó WEIGH-BRIDGE AUTOMATION SYSTEM

WebBridge Automation is an innovative solution designed to eliminate manual interaction at a weighbridge checkpoint.  
This system automates the process of recording vehicle entry details, including:

1. Vehicle weight  
2. Number plate recognition  
3. Timestamp of entry  

All data is captured and logged in real time into a database, creating a seamless and efficient workflow.

## üîß TECH STACK

1. **Programming Language:** C++ *(Java optional for future enhancement)*  
2. **Database:** MySQL *(with additional support for MS Excel and CSV storage)*  
3. **Hardware Interface:** Microcontroller integration with sensors and peripherals

## üß† CORE FUNCTIONALITIES

### 1. Vehicle Detection
Captures vehicle entry on a bridge-like platform using IR sensors or ultrasonic sensors.

### 2. Weight Measurement
Uses a Load Cell to read the vehicle‚Äôs weight.  
Microcontroller converts analog signals to digital and sends them to the system.

### 3. Number Plate Recognition
Uses a camera module for license plate scanning.  
Can be integrated with **OpenCV** for future enhancement.

### 4. Real-Time Data Logging
Stores data in a **MySQL** database with timestamps.

## üì¶ NEW DATA STORAGE SUPPORT

The system now supports **multiple data storage formats**, enabling greater flexibility and compatibility:

| Format | Description | Use Case |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **MySQL** | Primary database for real-time storage | Core backend data handling |
| **CSV** | Lightweight, portable text-based format | For exporting logs and reports |
| **Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)** | Structured spreadsheet format | For detailed analysis and archiving |

### üíæ Export/Import
Users can export data in **CSV** or **Excel** format, or import it back into the system for further processing.  
This allows easy integration with external analytics tools or backups.

## üíª PLATFORM SUPPORT

The project can now run on multiple platforms beyond standard PCs:

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Arduino / ESP32** | ‚úÖ Supported | Core microcontroller integration |
| **Raspberry Pi** | üß© New | Suitable for lightweight on-device data logging and automation |
| **Other SBCs (BeagleBone, Odroid)** | üîÑ Planned | Compatible setup in progress |

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 mysql-server -y
